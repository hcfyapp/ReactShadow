ReactShoadw@20.0.0 supports React 18 now.

--------------

This package is forked from [ReactShadow](https://github.com/Wildhoney/ReactShadow)@19.0.3, with only one modification to the original project: adding react 18 to the peer dependency.

If, like me, you [get an `ERESOLVE unable to resolve dependency tree error` when installing react-shadow using npm](https://github.com/Wildhoney/ReactShadow/pull/140#issuecomment-1326663553), then you can install this package instead.
